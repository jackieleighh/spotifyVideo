# spotifyVideo

This is a cross platform application using the Ionic framework.  It allows a Spotify user to play music off of their playlists while recording a video.

I decided to make this app because of the incompatibilty between the native iOS video recorder and Spotify.  Being into videography, this seemed like a fun project to do in my spare time.

### This is still a work in progress - date of completion: TBD
